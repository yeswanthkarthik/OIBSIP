I have completed Task-2(NUMBER GUESSING GAME) on java programming which is an internship project given by OASIS INFOBYTE.
I developed this game by using GUI(Graphical User Interface).
About Game:
The game interface contains two Text areas and two buttons one is to generate the number and other is to guess the number.
The first button(Generate the number) will generate a number randomly between 1-100. 
The second button(Guess the number) is for user.User have 10 attempts to guess the number.
First text area says whether the number is generated or not and other text area will give clues like,the entered number is lower number or larger number.  
Based on the number of attempts the score and points will be allocated.For every wrong guess the user will lose 1 ponit.
